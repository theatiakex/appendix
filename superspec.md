# System Specification (superspec.md)

## 1. Task Definition
Based on the operational parameters defined in your agent profile (`agents_super.md`), your task is to implement the backend module for technical quality control (QC) of subtitles. 

The system must handle SRT, WebVTT, and TTML formats, and synchronize with external "shot change" data.

## 2. Architectural Requirements

### 2.1 Internal Data Model
All solutions must use a unified, internal representation of subtitle data that is completely agnostic and independent of the input format.
* Must represent individual `Cues` containing a start time, end time, and text content.
* Must support multiple lines per cue.
* Must be able to handle external attributes (e.g., arrays of timestamps for shot changes).

### 2.2 Parsers
The module must contain separate, isolated parsers for the following formats, converting raw data into the internal data model:
* **SRT**
* **WebVTT**
* **TTML** (XML-based)

### 2.3 Rule Engine (QC Engine)
All QC rules must be applied exclusively to the internal data model.
* The results of the evaluation must be structured, traceable, and JSON-serializable.
* The engine must support the addition of new rules without affecting the parsing logic.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)
The following scenarios act as the objective performance contract. The implementation is only considered complete when the code satisfies all scenarios.

### Feature 1: Basic Text and Timing Rules
Feature: Validation of text amount and display duration

  Scenario: MaxLines - A subtitle with too many lines should be rejected
    Given an internal cue contains 3 lines of text
    When the QC check "MaxLines" is run with a threshold of 2
    Then the result should be "Failed"

  Scenario: MaxCpl - A line exceeds the allowed character length
    Given an internal cue contains a line with 45 characters
    When the QC check "MaxCpl" is run with a threshold of 42
    Then the result should be "Failed"
  
  Scenario: MaxCps - A subtitle with a high reading speed should be rejected
    Given an internal "cue" contains 60 characters
    And the display duration for the cue is 2.0 seconds
    When the QC check "MaxCps" is run with a threshold of 20 characters per second
    Then the result should be "Failed"

  Scenario: MinDuration - A subtitle is displayed for too short a time
    Given an internal cue has a display time of 0.5 seconds
    When the QC check "MinDuration" is run with a threshold of 1.0 seconds
    Then the result should be "Failed"

  Scenario: OverlapCheck - Two subtitles overlap in time
    Given cue A ends at 00:01:10.000
    And cue B starts at 00:01:09.500
    When the QC check "OverlapCheck" is run
    Then the result for cue B should be "Failed"

  Scenario: EmptyCueCheck - A subtitle lacks text content
    Given an internal cue contains only spaces and line breaks
    When the QC check "EmptyCueCheck" is run
    Then the result should be "Failed"

### Feature 2: Integration of External Data (Shot Changes)
Feature: Validation against visual cuts

  Scenario: CrossShotBoundaryCheck - A cue spans across a cut
    Given an internal cue has a start time of 00:05:00.000 and an end time of 00:05:04.000
    And external shot change data indicates a cut at 00:05:02.000
    When the QC check "CrossShotBoundaryCheck" is run
    Then the result should be "Failed"

  Scenario: MinFramesFromShotChange - A cue starts too close to a cut
    Given a cut occurs at frame 1000
    And an internal cue starts at frame 1001
    When the QC check "MinFramesFromShotChange" is run with a threshold of 2 frames
    Then the result should be "Failed"
